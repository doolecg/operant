# AgentLand 1.0.0

First release. AgentLand is a tiling workspace for terminal AI agents. You can run Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI or any other command-line agent side by side, and get a Windows notification when one needs you.

**Install:** download `AgentLand-1.0.0.msi` and run it. It installs per-user, so there's no admin prompt. Later versions install themselves.

## New
- **Any terminal agent:** Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode and Gemini CLI are set up already. You can add any other command in ⚙ Settings › Agents, with its own name, icon and arguments, and choose which one is the default. If an agent's CLI isn't installed, its tile tells you how to install it.
- **Agent launcher** (default `Alt+N`, or the ＋ in the top bar): press `1`–`9` to open an agent, or hold `Shift` to choose a folder first. `Alt+Enter` opens the default agent straight away.
- **Windows notifications** when an agent finishes and is waiting for you, rings the terminal bell, or a Claude subagent finishes. Click one to jump to that tile. You can change this in ⚙ Settings › Notifications.
- **16 themes**, including Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Rosé Pine, Everforest, Solarized, One Dark and two new ones, Midnight and Terminal. Most set their own terminal colors.
- **Everything from Claude Agent Viewer:** Hyprland-style master and dwindle layouts, nine workspaces, a live tile for each Claude Code subagent, idle tiles that close themselves, rebindable keys, the Settings page, the *Open in AgentLand* Explorer entry, and auto-updates from GitHub releases.
- **Agents find their commands** even when they were installed after AgentLand started, because tiles pick up the current `PATH` from Windows.
